## Installation & Details:
* [Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) mimics my [AnnePro2](https://www.annepro.net/) layout. [Hammerspoon](hammerspoon.org/) does the rest. So Karabiner + Hammerspoon is for Macbook and Hammerspoon only is for macmini with AnnePro2
* You must clone or download zip with this repo to `~/projects/dotfiles`. Rename the paths across the code if you want to use a different path
* I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to maintain the project
* Use `~/projects/dotfiles/hammerspoon/Spoons/Hotkeys.spoon/init.lua` to adjust or at least know almost all hotkeys around
* Run
```bash
sh ./install.sh
```
 to install everything. Check the script to see what it does:

 * homebrew packages installation
 * symlinks
 * terminal setup

Next:
* Replace my name and email in `gitconfig` with yours please
* Set CapsLock to do nothing in settings
* Set screenshot shortcuts to another shortcuts (even if they are turned off) for [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/) could take them



## Extra

* Windows legacy dotfiles
