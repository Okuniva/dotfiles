## Installation & Details:
* [Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) mimics my [AnnePro2](https://www.annepro.net/) layout. [Hammerspoon](hammerspoon.org/) does the rest. I don't need Karabiner on a mac without my keyboard
* You must download zip with this repo to `~/projects/dotfiles`. Rename the paths across the code if you want to use a different path
* I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to maintain the dotfiles
* Use `~/projects/dotfiles/hammerspoon/Spoons/Hotkeys.spoon/init.lua` to adjust almost all hotkeys
* Run
```bash
sh ./install.sh
```
 to install everything. Check the script to see what it does
* Replace my name and email in `gitconfig` with yours please
* Set CapsLock to do nothing in settings
* Set screenshot shortcuts to another shortcuts (even if they are turned off) for [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/) could take them



## Extra
* [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) settings
* Windows legacy dotfiles
